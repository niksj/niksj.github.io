    <p>Hi folks, I'm Senior Software Engineer at Bloomberg in London, where I work predominantly on back-end services. I previously worked for Walmart Bangalore. I'm passionate about creating scalable and performant back-end infrastructure to deliver the best experience. I'm an open source enthusiast, a former Google Summer of Code (GSoC) participant, a benevolent of Sigmah (the open source organization), a developer member of Fossasia and Systers, a member of the Coursera open source community, and CybrosX Member of IEEE Women in Tech. When not engrossed in code, you will find me mentoring students and volunteering for various programs like GSoC, Google Code-In (GCI), RGSoC, LITG, GirlScript SoC, and more. I'm recipient of the prestigious Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) and GHCI Scholarships, and have served on the GHC Open Source, Software Engineering, and Scholarship tracks review committees for the past 5+ years. I was the organizer for the fourth edition of “Learn IT, Girl,” an international mentorship program for women. I also love singing and reading novels or trying out some unknown adventure.</p>
