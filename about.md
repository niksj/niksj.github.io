<div class="column leftcol">

Hi folks, I am a Machine Learning Engineer by Profession and co-author of the book Sculpting Data for ML. I developed a passion for identifying and tackling novel and practical problems using Machine Learning during my research internships at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, which I further explored during my Master's in Computer Science from the University of California San Diego. I try to combine my past engineering experiences in designing large-scale systems, working at Amazon and Arcesium (a D.E. Shaw company), and research experiences in Applied Machine Learning to develop distributed Machine Learning relevance systems at Twitter.

My explorations have led to several research publications in competitive ML conferences like RecSys, ACL, and WSDM (with 150+ citations). The ML community has also well received the datasets collected (also used in the book) as part of my research. Kaggle recently ranked me as one of the top 20 dataset contributors on the platform, and Deeplearning.ai's "Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow" course on Coursera used my Sarcasm Detection dataset for teaching purposes. 
  
These days, I'm actively working on promoting data centric view and approaches in AI, which is also one of the topics in our book Sculpting Data for ML. Follow DataForML handle on <a href="https://twitter.com/DataForML" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dataforml/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to stay up-to-date.
  
In my downtime, I enjoy watching sci-fi shows, working-out, video gaming, and spending time with my family. I presently live in the Bay Area.

<!-- I consider myself a lifelong learner and believe in working hard. I graduated from UC San Diego with a Master's in Computer Science with a Machine Learning specialization in June 2018. I'm currently working at Twitter in the Timelines Quality team, building relevance and machine learning systems. Previously, I worked at Amazon with Amazon Expansions and Exports Tech team. <br> <br> -->

<!-- My interests are in the Applied ML, Recommender Systems, and NLP domains. I got my first exposure to Machine Learning during my internships at IIT Madras, India, developing scalable Bayesian models for the movie rating prediction tasks. <br> <br> -->

<!-- At UC San Diego, I worked on several research projects under the guidance of Prof. Julian McAuley. Recently, one of our research papers got accepted at <a href="http://acl2019.org/EN/index.xhtml" target="_blank">ACL 2019</a>. We proposed a neural network architecture to detect spoilers in review datasets and contributed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/reviews" target="_blank">extensive book review dataset</a> for spoiler detection. We published another work at RecSys 2018 last year. We proposed a new machine learning framework for predicting the fit of clothing products to recommend appropriate product sizes to customers. The proposed approach improves upon a method proposed by Amazon by up to 18%. In this work, we released two <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation" target="_blank">novel datasets</a>, collected specifically for the task of clothing size recommendation. <br> <br> -->

<!-- Apart from this, I interned at Amazon in Summer 2017. My project was to support primary key constraints, batch inserts/updates, transactions, and compaction in Hive while ensuring read consistency. This project was particularly challenging as the Hive is not designed to handle transactional data and operations. I also worked with Arcesium, a recently formed subsidiary of D.E. Shaw & Co, as a Software Developer. I was responsible for revamping the infrastructure while ensuring scalability and robustness. <br> <br> -->

<!-- My industry experience helps me understand the intricacies involved in developing critical and time-intensive software. In contrast, my research experience is providing me an in-depth knowledge of the Machine Learning field. These learnings drive all of my work. <br> <br> -->
